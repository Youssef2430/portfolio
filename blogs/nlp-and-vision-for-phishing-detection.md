# How I Built a Phishing Detector I Actually Trust (Multi-Model, Privacy-First, Battle-Tested)

I get a lot of email—grad school, NRC work, side projects—and every week there’s at least one message that looks legit but smells wrong. I wanted a detector that feels like my own instincts, just sharper and faster. So I built one: a production-ready, multi-model system that runs locally or in the cloud, explains itself, and doesn’t break when real-world email gets messy.

## TL;DR

* **Ensemble > single model.** I combine a fine-tuned RoBERTa, GPT-class LLMs (OpenAI/Claude), and local LLMs (via Ollama) to catch different attack styles.
* **Privacy options by design.** Local-only mode so sensitive emails never leave my infrastructure; cloud mode for heavier reasoning when I allow it.
* **Productionized.** Flask API, Dockerized, Nginx + SSL, deployed on a Hetzner VPS (custom domain), with monitoring and graceful fallbacks.
* **Transparent decisions.** Verbose mode shows each model’s vote + rationale so I can debug false positives quickly.
* **Roadmap.** Browser extension, richer HTML/metadata analysis, federated learning, and graph-level campaign detection.

## Why I cared enough to build this

* **My inbox is mission-critical.** I’m juggling a Master’s at uOttawa and part-time engineering at the National Research Council. Missing an email from a supervisor is bad; trusting a fake “invoice due” is worse.
* **I’m privacy-obsessed.** I’ve shipped other privacy-first tools (e.g., local finance dashboards), and I want the same control for email security: **on-device or self-hosted first**, cloud only when I opt in.
* **I like systems that explain themselves.** Debugging hazy “blocked for safety” messages is painful. I want to know *why* an email got flagged.

## Design principles (the guardrails I kept)

1. **Model-agnostic:** Hot-swap models (local/cloud) without rewiring the app.
2. **Production-first:** Clean startup, fast first inference, retries/backs-offs for flaky APIs.
3. **Extensible:** New models and preprocessing steps drop in with minimal friction.
4. **Explainable by default:** Per-model outputs, confidence, and short rationales.

## The system at a glance

* **Preprocessing Engine:** Minimal but surgical cleanup—strip/normalize URLs and special characters while preserving the “tells” (punctuation, layout hints, phrasing).
* **Model Orchestrator:** Routes requests (local vs cloud; speed vs accuracy), runs models in parallel, aggregates votes intelligently.
* **Core Models:**

  * **RoBERTa (fine-tuned):** Fast, pattern-sharp, offline.
  * **OpenAI GPT-class:** Contextual/social-engineering reasoning.
  * **Claude:** Great at subtle persuasion cues and edge cases.
  * **Local LLMs (Ollama):** Private, customizable, org-specific.
  * **Custom transformers:** For my own corpus/attack patterns.
* **API Server:** Flask routes, standard JSON responses, consistent error handling.
* **Infra:** Docker images, Nginx reverse proxy with SSL, Hetzner VPS, domain configured, caching + graceful degradation.
* **Monitoring:** Latency/error-rate focus; model-health probes; alerts when cloud providers hiccup.

## Why an ensemble (and how the votes work)

Different attacks stress different muscles:

* **RoBERTa** nails phrasing quirks and templated lures.
* **LLMs** reason about context: “Why would payroll email me from this domain?”
* **Local models** preserve privacy and can be tuned to my org’s email style.

I aggregate with **weighted voting** + **confidence gates**. Disagreement is a feature: when models split, I inspect those emails—they’re often the interesting edge cases.

## What surprised me (building from lab to prod)

* **The preprocessing paradox.** Over-sanitize and you erase the very fingerprints (spacing, punctuation, odd phrasing) that give phish away; under-sanitize and HTML noise derails tokenizers. The sweet spot took A/B tests on real corpora.
* **Startup choreography matters.** Preloading models vs lazy loading changed first-request latency from \~10–15s to sub-second. Orchestrating five models without RAM spikes required careful sequencing.
* **Metrics reality check.** Academic F1 on clean datasets ≠ field performance. Real mail is multilingual, messy, and evolving; I track precision aggressively because false positives are costly.
* **Provider hiccups happen.** OpenAI/Anthropic are quick—until they aren’t. Retries, timeouts, and local fallbacks are non-negotiable.

---

## Training notes (the RoBERTa story)

* **Data quality beats volume.** \~10k curated, well-labeled examples outperformed a noisy 100k dump.
* **Regularization + augmentation** prevented template memorization.
* **Longer context windows** helped with thread-based attacks where a legitimate thread gets hijacked later.

---

## Deployment & ops

* **Stack:** Flask + Docker (multi-stage builds), Nginx (SSL/headers), Hetzner VPS, domain configured, CI for image builds.
* **Performance:** Preloading critical models; async calls for cloud LLMs; caching frequent provider responses.
* **Resilience:** Clear fallbacks (cloud → local), uniform error payloads, circuit-breakers on provider timeouts.
* **Dev-prod parity:** Same images everywhere; config via env vars; reproducible runs.

---

## What I learned

* **Production ML = systems engineering.** The “model” part is half the work; the other half is startup, memory, latency, retries, and observability.
* **Explainability buys trust.** A quick rationale (“sender domain mismatch + urgent payment language”) turns a black box into a tool I can actually use.
* **Continuous adaptation is table stakes.** Attackers evolve; so must the detector. Monitoring drift matters more than a heroic single-point F1.

---

## Roadmap ? (near → far)

* **Near:** Gmail/Outlook extension with inline warnings; HTML/attachments parsing; sender-auth signals (SPF/DKIM/DMARC); model-drift alerts.
* **Next:** **Federated learning** so orgs can improve models without sharing raw mail; smarter ensemble weights based on scenario.
* **Later:** **Graph-level analysis** (campaign clustering across senders/domains), **behavioral signals** for account compromise.

## A personal note

I built this partly because I’m the friend people forward suspicious emails to (“Youssef, is this real?”). Now I have a tool that reflects how I think—privacy-first, explainable, and fast—and that I’m comfortable recommending to my lab mates and colleagues. It’s not “set and forget”; it’s a living system that learns with me.
