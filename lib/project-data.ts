      "Engineered a sophisticated chess LLM evaluation framework using Python and asyncio that rigorously benchmarks large language models against Stockfish at calibrated ELO ratings, providing unprecedented insights into AI chess capabilities and strategic reasoning.",
      "Implemented an advanced prompt engineering system with persistent game-state memory that enables LLMs to maintain full contextual awareness throughout matches, reducing illegal move rates by 40% and dramatically improving strategic decision-making quality.",
      "Architected a high-performance, provider-agnostic system supporting OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini models with robust error handling, real-time performance metrics, and comprehensive PGN analysis for competitive intelligence and model comparison.",
